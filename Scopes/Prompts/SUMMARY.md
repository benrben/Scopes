| Subject | File | One-Sentence Description |
|---------|------|--------------------------|
| **Core Development** | | |
| Test-Driven Development | STDD.md | Runs a TDD loop (Red → Green → Refactor) while maintaining Scopes as the source of truth for current behavior. |
| Research & Investigation | SRDD.md | Conducts evidence-backed research spikes combining repository reading and internet research, treating Scopes as current behavior truth. |
| Scope Generation & Updates | Init-Scopes-and-update.md | Generates initial Scopes documentation from code or updates existing Scopes to match observable reality, maintaining INDEX/GRAPH consistency. |
| **Planning & Organization** | | |
| Project Board Mapping | Scope-to-Project-Board-Builder.md | Maps Scopes into actionable project structures (epics/stories/tasks) with dependency-aware sequencing based on the scope graph. |
| Refactoring Planning | Refactor-Redesign-Planner.md | Creates incremental refactor plans that preserve behavior using Scopes as the behavioral contract, with phased migration strategies. |
| Feature Ideation | Feature-Ideation.md | Generates new feature ideas and translates them into Scopes-linked task candidates without inventing current behavior. |
| Idea → Research → TODO Scopes | Idea-Research-to-Todo-Scopes.md | Turns one idea into a short internet research note and a dependency-aware, Scopes-linked TODO scope plan for implementation. |
| Architecture Decisions | ADR-Writer.md | Writes Architecture Decision Records linked to affected Scopes, capturing context, decision, and consequences. |
| **Documentation & Maintenance** | | |
| Release Notes | Release-Notes-From-Scopes.md | Generates release notes by comparing Scopes changes, documenting user-visible, system, and developer-facing changes. |
| **Workflow & Collaboration** | | |
| Task Writing | Task-File-Writer.md | Produces high-quality, actionable task files linked to Scopes with acceptance criteria and evidence plans. |
| Research/Plan → Tasks | Research-Plan-to-Tasks.md | Reads research notes and TODO scopes plans, then converts each TODO scope into a concrete, actionable task file. |
| **Onboarding** | | |
| Learning Paths | Onboarding-Path-Builder.md | Creates onboarding paths that teach the product by reading Scopes and following traces, with suggested first contributions. |
